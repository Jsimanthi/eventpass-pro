### Project Analysis Summary

The project is a sophisticated event management system named "EventPass Pro." It's built with a Go backend, a React frontend, and a suite of powerful services managed by Docker.

**Backend:** The Go backend is well-structured, featuring a comprehensive API for managing events, users, invitees, and more. It includes advanced features like real-time updates via WebSockets, QR code generation, and data anonymization.

**Frontend:** The React frontend is in its early stages. It currently has a "Live" view for real-time check-in monitoring and a basic "Management" page for reprinting QR codes. The foundation is in place, but most of the backend's functionality has not yet been implemented in the user interface.

**Services:** The use of PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for data storage, Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for message queuing, and Minio for object storage demonstrates a well-architected and scalable system design.

### Project Completion Plan

Here is a strategic plan to develop the frontend and complete the project:

**Phase 1: Core Frontend Functionality**

1.  **Implement User Authentication:**
    *   **Login/Logout:** Create a secure login form to authenticate users and manage their sessions.
    *   **Registration:** Build a registration page for new users to create an account.
    *   **Token Management:** Implement a robust system for handling authentication tokens to ensure secure communication with the backend.

2.  **Event Management Dashboard:**
    *   **Event List:** Design and build a central dashboard to display a list of all events, showing key information at a glance.
    *   **CRUD Operations:** Implement features to create, read, update, and delete events from the frontend.

3.  **Invitee and QR Code Management:**
    *   **Invitee List:** For each event, display a detailed list of invitees with their current status (e.g., "invited," "checked-in").
    *   **CSV Upload:** Develop a user-friendly interface for uploading invitee lists from a CSV file.
    *   **Search and Filter:** Add powerful search and filtering capabilities to make it easy to find specific invitees.

**Phase 2: Advanced Features and User Experience**

4.  **Interactive QR Code Scanning:**
    *   **Camera Integration:** Integrate a QR code scanning library to enable check-ins directly from a device's camera.
    *   **Real-Time Validation:** Provide instant feedback to the user on the validity of a scanned QR code.

5.  **Enhanced "Live" Dashboard:**
    *   **Data Visualization:** Add charts and graphs to visualize check-in data in real-time, providing valuable insights into event attendance.
    *   **UI/UX Improvements:** Enhance the design of the live dashboard to make it more intuitive and visually appealing.

6.  **Comprehensive Management and Reporting:**
    *   **Reprint Requests:** Build out the UI for managing and tracking QR code reprint requests.
    *   **Data Export:** Allow users to export event and invitee data for reporting and analysis.
    *   **User Management:** Create an administrative interface for managing user accounts.

**Phase 3: Backend and Worker Integration**

7.  **Background Job Processing:**
    *   **Worker Logic:** Implement the backend logic for the `worker` and `reprinter` services to process background tasks efficiently.
    *   **Queue Monitoring:** Provide visibility into the status of background jobs and message queues.

8.  **Data Anonymization Interface:**
    *   **Privacy Controls:** If required, build a secure interface to manage the anonymization of user, invitee, and order data in compliance with privacy regulations.

**Phase 4: Testing, Deployment, and Monitoring**

9.  **Rigorous Testing:**
    *   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Write comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the code.
    *   **End-to-End Testing:** Perform thorough testing of the entire application to guarantee a seamless user experience.

10. **Production-Ready Deployment:**
    *   **Deployment Configuration:** Prepare and document the process for deploying the application to a production environment.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

11. **Monitoring and Analytics:**
    *   **Prometheus and Grafana:** Configure a monitoring stack to collect and visualize metrics from all services.
    *   **Logging:** Implement a centralized logging system to make it easier to debug and troubleshoot the application.
